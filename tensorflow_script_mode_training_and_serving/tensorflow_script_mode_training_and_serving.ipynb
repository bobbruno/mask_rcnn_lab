    "# TensorFlow script mode training and serving\n",
    "\n",
    "Script mode is a training script format for TensorFlow that lets you execute any TensorFlow training script in SageMaker with minimal modification. The [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) handles transferring your script to a SageMaker training instance. On the training instance, SageMaker's native TensorFlow support sets up training-related environment variables and executes your training script. In this tutorial, we use the SageMaker Python SDK to launch a training job and deploy the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Script mode supports training with a Python script, a Python module, or a shell script. In this example, we use a Python script to train a classification model on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). In this example, we will show how easily you can train a SageMaker using TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.0 scripts with SageMaker Python SDK. In addition, this notebook demonstrates how to perform real time inference with the [SageMaker TensorFlow Serving container](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-tensorflow-serving-container). The TensorFlow Serving container is the default inference method for script mode. For full documentation on the TensorFlow Serving container, please visit [here](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/tensorflow/deploying_tensorflow_serving.rst).\n",
